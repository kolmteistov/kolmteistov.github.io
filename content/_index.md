# Welcome to my Security Research Corner 🔒

> **"Doing my best with a broken PC and a smartphone."**

Welcome! This space is where I document my deep dives into cybersecurity, malware analysis, and high-performance cryptography.

Right now, I’m focused on **Salsa20-based Intermittent Encryption**. It’s a technique often seen in modern ransomware for speed, but I’m dissecting it to build better, faster data protection engines.

### 🚀 Featured Research: Salsa20 MMF Engine
I'm currently developing an engine that achieves **5-10x faster encryption** by processing strategic chunks of data instead of the whole file, utilizing Memory-Mapped Files (MMF) for minimal RAM usage.

### 📱 The Mobile Chronicles
Yes, due to a hardware failure, this entire project—from coding to documentation—is being developed on a smartphone via **Termux**. It’s not ideal, but research doesn't stop for a broken PC.

**Stay tuned, more research is coming.** ☕🔥
