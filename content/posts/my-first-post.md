## The Challenge

Doing cryptographic research on a smartphone isn't ideal, but it taught me valuable lessons about:

- Resource constraints
- Battery efficiency
- Real-world performance

## Mobile Optimization Techniques

### 1. ARM NEON Instructions

ARM processors have SIMD instructions that can process multiple data in parallel.

### 2. Cache Optimization

Understanding L1/L2 cache behavior is crucial for performance.

### 3. Battery Considerations

Crypto operations can drain battery quickly if not optimized.

## Lessons Learned

Working with limited resources forces you to write **efficient code** from the start.
